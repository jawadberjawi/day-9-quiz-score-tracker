# 📊 Day 9: Quiz Score Tracker — Java Console Project

Today I built a real-world Java console application that helps track quiz scores for multiple students and calculate the class average.

## 👨‍🏫 Project Summary

This beginner-friendly program asks the user how many students took a quiz, then loops through each student to collect their name and grade. At the end, it calculates the average score and gives the user the option to run the process again without restarting the program.

## 💡 What I Practiced

- `for` loop to iterate over each student
- `while` loop to repeat the whole process
- `Scanner` for real-time input
- `double`, `String`, and `int` data types
- Clean code structure and logical separation
- Committing with Git inside IntelliJ

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
How many students took the quiz? 3  
What is the student's name? Alice  
What is the student's quiz grade? 90  
What is the student's name? Bob  
What is the student's quiz grade? 85  
What is the student's name? Carol  
What is the student's quiz grade? 95  

Class average score: 90.0  
Do you want to review again? Type 'yes' to repeat or 'no' to exit: no  
Thank you! Program ended.
